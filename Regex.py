# Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and manipulation of strings. Python provides the re module, which allows you to work with regular expressions

# One of the fundamental operations with regex is pattern matching. You define a pattern using a combination of characters and special symbols that represent a specific set of strings you want to match

# example
import re




def check_for_email(email:str):

    pattern = r'^\w+@\w+\.\w+$'
   
    matches = re.match(pattern, email)
    print(matches)

    if matches:
        print("Valid email")
    else:
        print('invalid email')

# inp = input('Email: ')

# check_for_email(inp)

# r = rawstring
# \w = matches one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores). 
# ^ = to comfirm/assert the start of a string
# \. =  matches the literal "." symbol.
# $ = asserts the end of the string.
# + = The + sign is a metacharacter in regular expressions that specifies that the preceding element should occur one or more times
# * = the * sign allows the pattern to match elements that can occur zero or more times, making them optional
# {} = The {} sign is a quantifier metacharacter in regular expressions that allows you to specify the exact number of occurrences of the preceding element. It allows you to specify a specific range or an exact count for the number of repetitions

# E.g
# \d{3} matches exactly three consecutive digits.
# [a-z]{2,4} matches a sequence of lowercase letters that is between 2 and 4 characters long.
# a{5} matches exactly five consecutive occurrences of the letter 'a'

# \d, \w, and \s - a digit, word, or space character, respectively.
# \D, \W, and \S - anything except a digit, word, or space, respectively.
# [abc] -	any character between the brackets (such as a, b, ).
# [^abc] - any character that isnâ€™t between the brackets.





# pattern = r'[a-zA-Z]{2,4}'
# string = 'This is why I like regex'
# matches = re.match(pattern,string)
# print(matches)


# regex  method/Funtions 

# 1. match()

# pattern = r'^\d{3}'
# pattern = r'[a-zA-Z]'
# string = input('value: ')
# matche = re.match(pattern, string)
# print(matche)
# if matche:
#     print('There is a match')
# else:
#     print('No match found')

# 2. search()

# pattern = r'\d{3}'
# string = input('value: ')
# match = re.search(pattern, string)
# print(match)
# if match:
#     print('Match found')
# else:
#     print('No match found')

# 3. findall()
# 
# pattern = r'\d{3}'
# string = 'I have 323 apples and 234 oranges 567'
# matches = re.findall(pattern, string)
# print(matches)

# 4. sub()

# pattern = r'\d+'
# string = 'I have 323 apples and 234 oranges 5679'
# replacement = 'some'
# modified_string = re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)
# print(modified_string)


# 5. group()

# The .group() method is used to retrieve the matched substring or subgroups from a match object obtained through the re.match() or re.search() functions in Python.

# pattern = r'(\w+)-(\d+)-(\d+)'
# string = 'apple-123-3435'

# match = re.search(pattern, string)
# if match:
#     print(match)
#     print(match.group())
#     print(match.group(1))
#     print(match.group(2))
#     print(match.group(3))






# Assignment
# 1. You can use regex to extract the domain names from a list of email addresses
# 2. You can use regex to parse and extract data from CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files.
# import re

# csv_data = open('C:\\all_python\\online_class\\details.csv', mode='r')
# data = csv_data.read()
# print(data)
# pattern = r'(\w+),(\w+),(\d+),(\w+)'
# matches = re.findall(pattern, data)
# print(matches)

# for match in matches:
#     print(match)
# data = [{'first_name':match[0], 'last_name':match[1], 'age':match[2], 'city':match[3]} for match in matches ]
# print(data)

# csv_file = open(r"C:\python-works\python_works\student_grades.csv", mode='rt')
# data = csv_file.read()

# matches = re.findall(r'(\w+) (\w+),(\d+),(\w)', data)
# # print(matches)

# student_details = [{'First Name': each[0], 'Last Name':each[1], 'Score': each[2], 'Grade':each[3]} for each in matches]
# # print(student_details)

# user = input('password: ')
pattern = r"['a-zA-Z0-9\W']{8,20}"

# 3. You can use regex to validate the strength of passwords based on specific criteria
# 4. You can use regex to remove HTML tags from a string and extract the plain text content
# 5. You can use regex to extract hashtags from a text or social media content
# 6. You can use regex to validate URLs and ensure they follow a specific format
